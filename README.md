Open Freight App
=============

Open Freight App is a project by the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC) to share with regional and national transportation planning partners the template and tools that are the basis for the [PhillyFreightFinder](http://www.dvrpc.org/webmaps/phillyfreightfinder/) web mapping and data application. Through this effort, DVRPC hopes that county planning agencies, metropolitan planning organizations and state departments of transportation, and economic development agencies can leverage this template to further their efforts in making freight transportation data public. By utilizing the Open Freight App template, rather than building from scratch, planning agencies can focus their time and resources on the development of data sets that can serve to improve the access to information on freight facilities and their role in economic development and transportation across the country. 

The Open Freight App project is available as an open-source template under the MIT License. A working demo is [available here](http://dvrpcfreight.github.io/open-freight-app/).
