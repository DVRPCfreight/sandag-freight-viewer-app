SANDAG Freight Viewer App
=============

SANDAG Freight Viewer is the product of SANDAG’s continuing, comprehensive freight planning program. This program enables public stakeholders as well as carriers and shippers to participate in the metropolitan planning process and identifies freight transportation assets and trends for the San Diego Region.

SANDAG Freight Viewer represents a true public-private partnership made possible by the members and friends of SANDAG’s Freight Stakeholder Working Group (FSWG).  The FSWG has provided active input and guidance in designing and preparing the Freight Viewer.

To learn more about the SANDAG’s freight planning activities and freight advisory committee, please visit the freight page of the SANDAG website. SANDAG Freight Viewer represents a highly collaborative undertaking made possible by the members and friends of the FSWG and is modeled on the nationally recognized Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission’s PhillyFreightFinder.
