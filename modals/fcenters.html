            <p>A 2012 DVRPC report entitled, <i>The Delaware Valley Freight Center Inventory: Taking Stock of a Vital Regional Asset</i>, applied a traditional planning approach of identifying and stratifying centers (e.g., as used in the DVRPC long-range plan, <i>Connections</i>) and designated major concentrations of freight transportation activity in the region. F<i>reight Centers</i> are defined as contiguous land parcels (under either joint or individual ownership) that are dedicated to one of the following types of freight activity: light manufacturing, heavy manufacturing, distribution, transportation, quarry/mining, and utility. </p>
                <p>The Freight Centers were identified using GIS data, field visits, stakeholder input, and Internet research. A minimum size of 250 acres was established, with allowances for smaller Freight Centers or new categories to be created at a future date. Factors such as shared infrastructure and commodities handled were considered when drawing up Freight Center boundaries. </p>
                <p>The Freight Centers were placed into one of three categories, based primarily on acreage, with one slight adjustment made based on employment data. The breakdown of the region’s 44 identified Freight Centers and the definition of the three categories are:</p>

                <p><img src="lib/images/flat/19.png" class="modal_icon"/>Mega Freight Centers are the largest size of identified centers with at least 1,500 acres of freight-related land use or over 3,000 manufacturing jobs. The concentration of land within the Mega Freight Centers tends to be pronounced, in large part because several of them are owned by a single firm or industrial real estate developer. Of note, all eight of the region’s Mega Freight Centers are served, or have the possibility of being served, by at least three different modes of transportation.</p>
                <p>The region’s eight identified Mega Freight Centers are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Falls/Keystone Industrial Port Complex</li>

Seven of the nine counties in the DVRPC region have a Major Freight Center and six of them are located along the Delaware River.</p>

                <p><img src="lib/images/flat/17.png" class="modal_icon"/>Intermediate Freight Centers consist of 250 to 700 acres of freight-related land use, or less than 250 acres with over 3,000 manufacturing jobs. While Mega and Major Freight Centers tend to be more tightly bunched, several of the Intermediate Freight Centers are more spread out. Most Intermediate Freight Centers fall into two patterns of development: a series of independent industrial parks; or a cluster dominated by a large manufacturing facility.</p>
                <p>The Intermediate Freight Centers are the most numerous of the three center designations (i.e., 23 in total) and offer considerable geographic diversity. Intermediate Freight Centers are spread relatively equally throughout the region, instead of being concentrated solely along the Delaware River.</p>
