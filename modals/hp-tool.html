</div>
<div class="modal-body">
    <p>An efficient highway system is integral to the freight economy and transportation system. This tool makes full use of the National Performance Management Research Data Set (NPMRDS) to illustrate two performance measures for the network throughout the day. The NPMRDS data utilized for this tool is restricted to “truck only” records created from ATRI probe data in NPMDRS.</p>
    <p>For each of the indicators, the data was analyzed for the TMC links in the DVRPC region and calculated for each of nine time bins throughout the day.</p>
    <h5>Truck Travel Time Index</h5>
    <p>Travel Time Index (TTI) is calculated based on travel time represented as a percentage of the ideal travel time, or more simply, Average Travel Time / Free-Flow Travel Time. TTI was calculated for all TMC links in the regional network for which enough data was available. The resulting index is an indicator of the length of extra time spent in the transportation system during a trip.</p>
    <h5>Truck Average Speed</h5>
    <p>Truck Average Speed is the average speed over a given TMC based on the average travel time and TMC length based on the raw NPMRDS data. Average speed for trucks is important to calculate as a foundation to understand the performance of the network for trucks versus other vehicles.  </p>
